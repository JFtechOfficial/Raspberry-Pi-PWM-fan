# Raspberry-Pi-PWM-fan
Based on [Aerandir14's instructable.](https://www.instructables.com/id/PWM-Regulated-Fan-Based-on-CPU-Temperature-for-Ras/) 

I use a 60mm 5V 0,2A fan.

[The circuit needed to drive it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JFtechOfficial/Raspberry-Pi-PWM-fan/master/PWM_fan_circuit.png) has (from the bottom): 
* 5V, GND and GPIO inputs (from left to right)
* 1kOhm resistor
* a 2N2222 NPN transistor
* a diode
* 5V and GND output for the fan (from left to right)
